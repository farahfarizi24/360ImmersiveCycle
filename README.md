# 360ImmersiveCycle

An Augmented Reality Android application designed to assess a user's ability to identify road hazards while biking. The application presents three types of tests, each using multiple 360-degree videos: Perception Test, Comprehension Test, and Projection Test.

**This application is a work in progress

### Software overview
* Device orientation is crucial for directing the userâ€™s vision. Users should be given an onboarding period to familiarize themselves with observing the 360-degree video.
* Data is stored based on the test being taken by the participant.
* Projection Test: Users tap on objects they consider hazards. Correct answers trigger sound feedback.
* Perception Test: Users tap the stop button when they encounter a hazard that requires braking.
* Comprehension Test: At the end of the video, users answer questions about the hazards encountered and rate their confidence in their responses.
* Videos are loaded from internal files. To run the application with videos, please contact me to obtain them.
